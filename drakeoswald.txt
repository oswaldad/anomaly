Drake Oswald the man, the myth, the legend.
 
A rattlesnake once bit him… Drake bit back.

Drake is both left handed and right handed at the same time,
yet not ambidextrous.

Drake once decided to have a starring contest with the sun…
the sun blinked.

Instead of turning water into wine Drake changes his own pa-poo
into the most decadent chocolate.

Drake’s body is so efficient that he does not need to pee,
toxins are expelled through the skin.

Drake is so complex that his words and poetry have transcended
into a higher plane. For example:

Oh the brown fox. Destined for the weeping willows and sad sorrows.
Jump it does down wind. It… it… it indeed. Surely the cake will
entertain the lectern. As the tears spread from thine toes,
look upon thine sorrows. And the saying goes, DANCE PARTY YAAAA

If one were able to understand the depths of these words then
they would be thrown into a deep sorrow… never to return to joy.
